                Most people think artificial intelligence burst onto the scene with ChatGPT in 2022. They're off by
                about seven decades.
            </p>

            <p>
                The truth is, AI has been quietly shaping our world since <strong>1956</strong>, when a small group of
                scientists gathered at Dartmouth College for a summer workshop that would change everything. While the
                general public was just getting used to television, researchers were already dreaming of machines that
                could think.
            </p>

            <section>
                <h2>The Dartmouth Moment</h2>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 1956, John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and Nathaniel Rochester
                    organized what's now considered the birth of AI as a formal field of study. They proposed that
                    "every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely
                    described that a machine can be made to simulate it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    That wasn't just academic speculation. It was a declaration of intent that governments and
                    corporations took very seriously.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>The Decades You Didn't Hear About</h2>
                <p>While most of us were living our lives, AI was working behind the scenes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The 1960s-70s:</strong> The Department of Defense poured millions into AI research
                        through DARPA. Early expert systems began making decisions in specialized domains. Meanwhile,
                        the public was still marveling at pocket calculators.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The 1980s:</strong> Major corporations like IBM, DEC, and Xerox invested heavily in AI
                        systems for internal use. Expert systems started diagnosing diseases and configuring computer
                        systems. The technology existed, but it lived in corporate labs and government facilities, not
                        in homes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The 1990s-2000s:</strong> Machine learning algorithms were already powering fraud
                        detection in banks, optimizing supply chains for retailers, and filtering your spam email.
                        Google's search engine? Built on AI from day one in 1998.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The 2010s:</strong> AI was everywhere and nowhere. It was recommending your Netflix
                        shows, tagging your Facebook photos, routing your Uber rides, and screening job applications.
                        But it worked invisibly, never announcing itself.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Why the Secrecy?</h2>
                <p>It wasn't exactly a conspiracy, but there were reasons this history stayed quiet:</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Competitive advantage:</strong> Companies using AI had a massive edge and weren't eager to
                    advertise their methods. Why would a hedge fund reveal the algorithms making them millions?
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Government applications:</strong> Military and intelligence uses of AI remained classified.
                    Pattern recognition for surveillance, logistics optimization for operations, strategic planning
                    systems—all hidden behind security clearances.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>The "AI Winter" effect:</strong> AI went through periods of overhype followed by
                    disappointment. Companies learned to call it "machine learning," "analytics," or "intelligent
                    systems" instead.
                </p>
            </section>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>The Great Reveal</h3>
                <p>
                    What changed? A few things converged: Cloud computing made massive processing power cheap.
                    Open-source frameworks democratized the tools. And critically, large language models became good
                    enough to feel like magic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When ChatGPT launched in November 2022, it wasn't introducing AI to the world. It was
                    <strong>introducing the world to AI</strong>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <section>
                <h2>What This Means For You</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>AI isn't experimental anymore.</strong> It's been battle-tested across decades in
                    high-stakes environments. The systems making decisions about your credit or medical diagnosis aren't
                    beta products—they're refined versions of decades-old technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The infrastructure was already built.</strong> When AI seemed to "suddenly" take over, it
                    wasn't magic. It was the visible tip of an iceberg that had been growing for generations.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Real Story</h2>
                <p>
                    AI didn't start two years ago with a clever chatbot. It started with scientists who believed
                    machines could learn, governments that funded that belief into reality, and corporations that turned
                    that reality into profit. For 70 years, AI has been the secret engine running increasingly large
                    parts of our world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only thing that's new is that now everyone can see it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>The 70-year secret is out. The question is: what do we do with the next 70 years?</em>
