            <h1>The $1.2 Trillion Question: Will You Lead or Follow?</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">A new study from MIT puts a price tag on the silent AI shift.</p>
        </header>

        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>We’ve all felt it lately—that quiet shift at work where things that used to take us all day are suddenly
                happening in seconds.</p>

            <p>A new study from <strong>MIT</strong> just put a price tag on that feeling: <strong>$1.2
                    trillion</strong>. That is the massive amount of American wages tied to tasks that AI can already
                handle today. Not "in the future," but right now.</p>

            <section class="feature-section">
                <p class="feature-label">The Hidden Shift:</p>
                <h2 class="feature-title">The Iceberg Index</h2>

                <div class="feature-body">
                    <p><strong>The Mission:</strong> Navigating the automation "under the water."</p>
                    <p>Most people wait for a "big event" like a headline about mass layoffs to realize the world has
                        changed. But researchers are calling this the <strong>Iceberg Index</strong>.</p>

                    <p>The layoffs you see in the news? That’s just the tip. The real impact is happening in the small,
                        everyday tasks in finance, healthcare, and creative work that are being quietly automated while
                        we sleep. This doesn't mean your job is going away—it means the <em>way</em> you do your job is
                        being fundamentally rewritten.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <h2>Mastery, Not Fear</h2>
            <p>The study actually gives us a reason to be hopeful. It isn't a forecast of job loss; it’s a map for
                adaptation. Disruption isn't just hitting the tech world—it’s hitting every one of us, from small-town
                clinics to big-city studios.</p>

            <p>The winners of this shift won't be the people who try to outwork the machine. They'll be the people who
                learn to <strong>direct</strong> the machine.</p>

                    <p>I noticed that most creators were spending more time being confused by AI than actually using it.
                        That’s why I built the <a href="https://thomasrahsaan-lab.github.io/ai-tools/"
                            class="cta-link">AI Solutions Finder</a>.</p>
